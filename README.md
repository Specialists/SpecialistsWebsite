Hey!

This is TRH4CK.

I haven't done any code yet but I would just like to explain how I work exactly...

The public directory is where I keep the ASSETS (css, js, etc..) and the private is the core (the base, classes, all the functions.)

If you try to upload the script to your server, it won't work as like I said it's not coded.

If you need anything, find me on Slack, HF:1101548, or skype: trh4ck

Thanks!
